      <h2>About Heartline</h2>
      <p>
        Heartline exists to bridge compassion and need quickly, directly, and
        without barriers.
      </p>
      <p>
        What began as a small effort to help families with basic needs like gas,
        groceries, and school supplies has grown into a focused initiative
        committed to making immediate, tangible impact in people’s lives. In our
        earliest days, Heartline was a simple idea: if someone was struggling to
        afford a tank of gas to get to work, or school supplies for their child,
        why should they have to wait weeks for help, if help came at all?
      </p>
      <p>
        We realized the gap wasn’t just in funding. It was in speed, trust, and
        connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Heartline is dedicated to solving small but urgent needs with
        care, transparency, and immediacy. We operate with minimal overhead and
        no middlemen, which means donations go straight toward things that
        matter most. Filling a tank, stocking a fridge, or preparing a child for
        school. We focus on micro-assistance that makes a macro difference in
        someone’s day.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that kindness is a powerful force for good. It can change
        lives, uplift communities, and create a ripple effect of generosity. By
        connecting people who want to help with those who need it most, we’re
        creating a community of compassion that transcends barriers and
        transforms lives.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a world where no one feels alone in their struggles. A world
        where kindness is the norm, not the exception. A world where help is
        immediate, accessible, and compassionate. We believe that together, we
        can create a future where everyone has the support they need to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        A world where people in crisis can receive help not someday, but right
        now because someone cared enough to give, and we made sure it reached
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heartline is more than a platform. It’s a direct line between everyday
        kindness and someone’s tomorrow.

      <h2>Why Crypto?</h2>
      <p>
        We accept donations in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT)
        because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ~ It’s global: anyone, anywhere can support a person in need,
          instantly.
        </li>
        <li>
          ~ It’s fast: traditional banking and charity systems take days or
          weeks. Crypto moves in minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          ~ It’s transparent: with public ledgers, donors can verify that their
          funds were received and used.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Crypto helps us eliminate delays, fees, and bureaucracy—allowing
        Heartline to stay lean, efficient, and focused entirely on helping
        people faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re not just a charity. We’re a movement. A movement to make kindness
        immediate, accessible, and impactful. And with your help, we can make
        that vision a reality.

      <h2>About the Founder</h2>
      <div class="founder">
        <img src="pounders.JPG" alt="Image of Camila Pounders" />
      </div>
      <p>
        I was born on January 7th, 2001, in Modesto, California. Life taught me
        responsibility early, my dad left when I was still young, and that meant
        stepping up to help my mom and care for my little sister. There were
        times when we struggled to fill up the tank or cover basic groceries,
        but we always found a way to keep going. I saw how powerful even the
        smallest act of help could be a neighbor’s kindness, a $20 bill in an
        envelope, a ride from someone who cared.
      </p>
      <p>Those memories stuck with me.</p>
      <p>
        Today, I serve as a Marine at Camp Pendleton, and while I wear a
        uniform, I’ve never stopped thinking about the people who feel like
        they're barely getting by. Not just here, everywhere. That’s why I
        started Heartline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heartline is my way of giving back, by creating a direct, fast, and
        compassionate way to help someone who’s struggling. Whether it's a gas
        card, grocery support, or school supplies, your donations go straight to
        someone who needs it, no red tape, no delay.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in the power of kindness. I believe that even a small act can
        change someone’s day, or even their life. And I believe that together,
        we can make a difference.
      </p>
      Every bit helps. Every person matters. And together, we make sure no one
      feels like they’re alone.
